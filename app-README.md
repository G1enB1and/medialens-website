# MediaLens

![MediaLens Logo](docs/Screenshots/MediaLens-Logo-1024.png)

**MediaLens helps you clean up duplicate and similar images with confidence, then becomes the fastest way to explore, understand, and organize your entire media library.**

If you’ve ever:

- Didn’t know which version to keep
- Ended up with multiple slightly different edits
- Struggled to find anything later

MediaLens is built for that entire experience, not just detection, but decision and long-term organization.

---

## Why MediaLens?

Most tools show duplicates.

**MediaLens shows what actually changed and helps you decide.**

- See differences like resolution, edits, format, text, and more
- Get clear “best version” recommendations based on your rules
- Review safely before anything is removed

No guesswork. No blind deletes.

---

## What it becomes after cleanup

Once your library is clean, MediaLens becomes your daily workspace:

- Fast search, filtering, and tagging
- Collections beyond folders
- Bulk editing across hundreds of files
- Timeline browsing by when things happened
- Deep metadata + AI understanding

---

## Built For

- AI image/video creators
- Photographers with large archives
- Video editors and content creators
- Dataset builders and researchers
- Anyone with messy, duplicate-heavy libraries

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Duplicate & Similarity Cleanup

MediaLens doesn’t just detect duplicates, it understands variations.

#### Detect

- Exact duplicates (content hash)
- Visually similar images (perceptual hashing)
- Edited, resized, compressed variants
- Crops, grayscale, watermark/text changes

#### Understand

Each group is labeled with meaningful differences:

- Resolution, size, format
- Cropped vs full
- Text detected
- Metadata richness
- Folder priority

### Decide

- ★ Best overall recommendation
- Configurable rules for what “best” means
- Auto-resolve entire libraries safely
- Metadata merge before deletion

Always transparent. Always reversible.

### Image Comparison

Evaluate two images without leaving your workflow.

- Side-by-side with reveal slider
- Synchronized zoom and pan
- “Best in comparison” suggestions
- Integrated keep/delete actions

Compare → decide → clean up.

#### Text OCR (Fast + AI)

- Extract text from images and video previews
- Choose:
  - Fast OCR (quick)
  - AI OCR (higher accuracy)
- Mark files as “No Text”
- Save and edit results directly

![Bulk OCR Editor](docs/Screenshots/Screenshot-Bulk-OCR-Editor.png)

---

#### OCR Review

- Large preview with zoom + pan
- Compare Fast OCR vs AI OCR vs your edits

### Built-in AI (Local & Private)

MediaLens includes optional **local AI models** to help organize your media without sending your files to the cloud.

- Generate tags automatically
- Generate descriptions
- High-accuracy OCR
- Works with AI-generated images

#### Designed for control

- Models install on demand
- Run locally (GPU or CPU)
- Never overwrite your data without permission

### Advanced Search

Find exactly what you're looking for without memorizing syntax.

- Visual query builder
- Combine tags, metadata, text, dates
- Save searches
- Sync between UI and raw search

### Metadata System

Go beyond filenames.

- Extract:
  - AI prompts & workflows
  - EXIF / camera data
  - Embedded metadata
- Edit metadata in bulk
- Persistent tagging via file hashing
- Works even if files move or rename
