# Change Log

## v1.4.6 (Current)

### Summary

This release is a broad polish and stability update across MediaLens, led by a much faster and more capable Image Editor. It also improves Settings, Bulk Editor refresh behavior, Action History stability, and native UI consistency so everyday workflows feel steadier across the app.

### Highlights

- Edit faster with accelerated blur, live brush strokes, drag-based Magic Wand selection, marching-ants outlines, and a new Lasso selection option.
- Work with text more reliably using scalable font handling, resizable on-canvas bounds, better toolbar size changes, remembered font choice, and improved zoom alignment.
- Use a cleaner native interface with more consistent Settings controls, better editor dropdowns, fixed Bulk Editor combo behavior, and steadier Action History row interaction.

### Added

- Added accelerated image-processing paths for Image Editor blur, brush, eraser, and Magic Wand operations using reusable NumPy and optional OpenCV-backed processing where available.
- Added live brush and eraser application during drag gestures so strokes are applied immediately instead of waiting for a delayed final pass.
- Added Photoshop-style Magic Wand drag sampling, selection-tool sizing, circle cursor feedback, and forced selection within the wand cursor size.
- Added animated marching-ants outlines for selection masks across selection tools.
- Added a Lasso selection tool with path-based selection support.
- Added add and subtract cursor markers for selection tools so the active selection mode is visible at the cursor.
- Added a live brush-tip preview that reflects opacity and edge softness values.
- Added direct on-canvas text transform bounds with move and resize handles for active text layers.
- Added safer font handling for text layers by blocking the problematic 8514oem font, normalizing legacy layers to scalable fonts, and remembering the last selected text font across sessions.
- Added a 1px grey border around Image Editor layer preview thumbnails.
- Added new Image Editor brush, eraser, fill, and text-alignment SVG assets, including dark-mode variants where needed.
- Added regression coverage for Image Editor live brush painting, Magic Wand dragging, selection outlines, text sizing, text bounds, font handling, toolbar focus behavior, and zoom-specific text overlay alignment.
- Added native Action History safeguards so dynamically created detail widgets and lower-table row clicks stay parented and routed correctly.

### Changed

- Changed Magic Wand selection cleanup so selected areas form more closed, filled regions instead of loose tolerance-only pixel islands.
- Changed the Magic Wand drag experience by removing the accented preview path line and using the selection outline itself as the main feedback.
- Changed Image Editor text sizing to render and measure with pixel-sized fonts so toolbar size values visibly scale text layers more predictably.
- Changed Image Editor text toolbar edits to target the intended text layer even when focus or active-layer state changes during editing.
- Changed Image Editor text selection behavior so toolbar edits preserve the previous highlighted or unhighlighted live text state instead of forcing a new state.
- Changed Image Editor text bounds so the editable transform box has more usable padding and aligns correctly across zoom levels.
- Changed Image Editor text color handling so the text tool follows the shared foreground color picker like the brush and fill tools.
- Changed live Image Editor brush, eraser, and Magic Wand interactions to avoid unnecessary full preview and UI refreshes during drag operations, cache selection overlays, and keep editing responsive even on large images.
- Changed Image Editor font and combo controls to use the shared themed combo path with fixed-height controls, predictable popup height, stable row sizing, and better closed-control alignment.
- Changed Image Editor alignment controls to use themed SVG menu buttons with corrected light and dark mode rendering.
- Changed Settings controls to use shared themed combos, spin boxes, buttons, tabs, and text inputs more consistently across light and dark mode.
- Changed Settings tab geometry, AI page tabs, Background Processes tabs, and scanner/OCR control styling so native settings pages align more consistently and avoid clipped or disconnected tab chrome.
- Changed shared native control heights and spacing so settings, editor toolbar controls, buttons, combos, line edits, and numeric inputs align more consistently.
- Changed Bulk Editor metadata settings so visibility changes made in Settings refresh live without requiring deselecting and reselecting files.
- Changed bulk metadata and bulk rename dropdowns back to the single-chevron custom combo path so duplicate arrows do not return.
- Changed Action History details so normal row clicks no longer fall through embedded action-cell widgets or create transient popup windows.
- Changed Image Editor opening from large gallery selections to prefer the current file and avoid expensive selection scanning.

### Removed

- Removed obsolete Image Editor text editing paths that could create phantom boxes, stale geometry, or unreliable resize behavior.
- Removed the old Magic Wand drag path preview line in favor of the cleaner selection-outline feedback.

---

## v1.4.5

### Summary

This release makes MediaLens much better at recognizing near-identical images with color filters or color shifts, while also tightening People review, bulk editing, and comparison behavior so labels and navigation stay more predictable.

### Highlights

- Detect filtered, recolored, and color-shifted versions of the same image more reliably in Similar Files.
- Review similar and duplicate groups with more trustworthy guidance thanks to smarter Best Overall handling that backs off when MediaLens cannot safely auto-pick a winner.
- Move through People galleries more smoothly with better review fallbacks, safer navigation behavior, improved bulk-tab persistence, and cleaner face-focused profile crops.

### Added

- Added colorhash-based color-shift detection so Similar Files can better group images that match structurally but differ mainly by applied color filters.
- Added a Color Shifted Pairs preference rule under Settings > Similar File Rules with Keep Both and Keep Newest options, defaulting to Keep Both.
- Added action-history-backed edited-image labeling so similar groups can identify MediaLens-edited files and use stronger original-versus-edited hints when provenance is reliable.

### Changed

- Changed Similar Files grouping at high and very high thresholds to stop missing close matches because of overly restrictive prefix bucketing.
- Changed similar-group labels to distinguish color-shifted matches more clearly and downgrade weak pixel-only matches to a neutral Color-shifted pair label when edit provenance is not strong enough.
- Changed duplicate and similar review auto-resolution so Best Overall is suppressed when keep-both rules apply or when MediaLens does not automatically mark any item for deletion.
- Changed the bottom comparison panel to follow the same no-best logic as the review gallery so color-shifted and other keep-both pairs no longer show a conflicting Best in Comparison label.
- Changed People card review entry behavior to open Review All automatically when Review Unconfirmed has nothing left to review.
- Changed People bulk-editor tab behavior so file-backed People views keep the last used tab across Review and Show All transitions, while the top-level People Gallery still stays locked to the People-only workflow where file tabs are not applicable.
- Changed People header navigation controls to avoid unpredictable folder-history behavior while People galleries or People review surfaces are active.
- Changed People profile-circle face crops and unnamed-face review thumbnails to use a gentler face zoom that keeps a bit more of the image in frame.
- Changed image-editor opening from gallery selections to prefer the current file and avoid expensive large-selection scanning that could stall the UI.

---

## v1.4.4

### Summary

This release expands MediaLens People workflows with a more complete gallery and review experience, stronger bulk editing, improved duplicate-face handling, and more polished People-specific controls throughout the app.

### Highlights

- Review one person across every image they appear in with new Show All, Review All, and Review Unconfirmed modes, plus faster bulk editing that stays centered on the People tab while still unlocking the other bulk tools when files are in scope.
- Manage people more directly with cleaner person-only context menus, a themed Manage dialog, custom profile pictures, hidden people and hidden groups, and better People-gallery status and navigation controls.
- Eliminate repeated cloned face entries across People review, bulk People summaries, and single-image People details by deduplicating duplicate face records at the shared data layer.

### Added

- Added Show All, Review All, and Review Unconfirmed person-gallery modes with sticky header controls for switching between People review states.
- Added a themed Manage dialog for People cards and person review headers with rename, group, favorite, ignore, visibility, and profile-picture actions.
- Added support for custom People profile pictures with built-in profile image switching controls.
- Added hide and show support for individual people and custom People groups, including filtering that respects the existing Show Hidden setting.
- Added a sticky header close button in person review views that returns directly to the normal gallery.
- Added a sticky People Gallery header with All, Unnamed, and Unconfirmed tabs, plus Scan for Faces and close controls that keep People navigation available without relying on the main header control.
- Added a People Show All folder-scope toggle so person-specific normal-gallery results can either use the person's complete image set or be limited to the current folder when needed.

### Changed

- Changed the header People control from a dropdown into a direct People button with inactive gray icon styling and active light or dark mode icons.
- Changed People Show All to use the normal gallery renderer and the user’s current gallery view, such as Masonry or Grid, instead of custom People face cards with bounding boxes.
- Changed People Show All scoping to use exact person-id filtering and a People-derived image scope by default, so results do not disappear when the current folder does not contain that person’s images.
- Changed People Show All refresh behavior so paging, infinite scroll, lightbox page changes, view changes, filters, sorting, and metadata-sensitive refreshes preserve the active person scope.
- Changed live search to render the first matching batch quickly and continue loading additional matching batches in the background for better responsiveness in large galleries.
- Changed People review and Show All bulk selection so the same bulk People editor used by the main People gallery opens by default, auto-loads the relevant files, and still allows switching to metadata, tags, OCR, captions, and rename tabs when files are selected.
- Changed People review bulk counts so the People section stays scoped to the currently selected files instead of the full person group.
- Changed People review galleries and related summaries to automatically deduplicate repeated face detections, preventing duplicate cards, inflated counts, and repeated names.
- Changed People card actions, person review context menus, and person-gallery header controls to focus on person workflows instead of generic image actions.
- Changed People card styling with circular profile images, a hover-only profile-picture switcher, stronger accent-aware hover states, and bolded person names.
- Changed People review presentation so Show All and review modes are separated cleanly, Confirm All hides when it is not relevant, and Review Unconfirmed hides when a person has nothing left to review.
- Changed the People gallery footer count chip to show named and unnamed people totals instead of a misleading file count.
- Changed the Include Nested Files header toggle to use the new custom file-tree SVG icon set.

### Removed

- Removed generic image-focused actions from People card context menus and person-group review menus where those actions did not match People workflows.

---

## v1.4.3

### Summary

This release refines the new MediaLens People workflows with stronger bulk-review behavior, better deduplication, per-person group management, and much better responsiveness when reviewing people with large image sets.

### Highlights

- Review people from the Bulk Editor more reliably with deduplicated face cards, cleaner per-image summaries, and counts that stay scoped to the files you are actually working on.
- Work through large people libraries more smoothly thanks to async loading, lazy thumbnail updates, cached people-per-image mappings, and better default splitter behavior.
- Manage group membership directly from each detected person card in the bulk People editor using the same custom typed dropdown workflow as People naming and renaming.
- Use a more polished bulk People image list with improved layout, clearer People summaries, per-image Ignore, and better thumbnail and button behavior in both wide and narrow panel sizes.
- Keep Review People, bulk People, and per-image summaries in sync with matching deduplication logic so duplicate bridge rows no longer create repeated cards or repeated names.

### Added

- Added per-person Rename and Ignore actions plus a collapsible Groups section to bulk People detected cards, including per-group remove actions and a custom typed Add to Group workflow.
- Added Ignore Unnamed support to the bulk People detected section when unnamed detections are present.
- Added per-image Ignore actions to bulk People selected-image cards alongside Scan for People and Review.
- Added context-aware bulk People image-source labeling so person-driven workflows clearly show image sets such as Images Containing Amy Rollins.

### Changed

- Changed single-person People Gallery selection to open the bulk People workflow, auto-populate Selected Images from that person or face selection, and reuse scoped caches for faster review setup.
- Changed bulk People image rows to use a more compact layout with People summaries, responsive button placement, and taller thumbnails aligned to the action stack.
- Changed bulk People selected-image summaries to show the full deduplicated People list for each image so the image list stays consistent with Review People.
- Changed Review People and related People surfaces to deduplicate repeated face records using face identifiers and bounding-box signatures so identical people no longer appear multiple times.
- Changed bulk People loading to populate large image sets asynchronously in batches, lazy-load visible thumbnails on scroll, and recenter the splitter when a new People context opens unless the user already resized it.
- Changed the bulk People bottom section label from Detected People to People for clearer wording across load states and refreshes.

### Removed

- Removed the old shared bulk People footer group actions in favor of per-person group controls inside each detected person card.

---

## v1.4.2

### Summary

This release significantly expands MediaLens People workflows with a redesigned Review People experience, broader bulk editing capabilities, and a shared naming system that makes organizing faces faster and more reliable.

### Highlights

- Review everyone found in one image from a dedicated Review People workspace with bounding boxes, face actions, and image-to-image navigation.
- Manage detected people directly from normal image selections in the Bulk Editor, including scan, rename, ignore, and group-management workflows scoped to the files you selected.

- Added bulk People support for normal image selections with a Selected Images review list, per-file Review and Scan for People actions, Scan All for People, and detected-people actions scoped only to the selected files.
- Added collapsible Selected Images and Detected People sections in the bulk People editor, including a persistent draggable splitter between them.
- Added per-person Rename and Ignore actions in the bulk People detected list plus Ignore Unnamed support when unnamed detections are present.
- Added a shared People name picker used throughout MediaLens with direct typing, known-name dropdowns, autocomplete suggestions, and Tab completion for faster naming workflows.
- Added per-group Remove from Group buttons on People cards and expanded multi-select support across People gallery, unconfirmed, and unnamed views.

### Changed

- Changed Review Faces in the details panel to open the native Review People workspace instead of a one-name popup so multiple faces in one image can be reviewed in context.
- Changed single-file and bulk People workflows to treat generated "Unnamed" identities consistently, ensuring the correct naming, ignore, and not-person actions are always available.
- Changed People scan refresh behavior so details, Review People, and bulk People views all update immediately after a scan completes.
- Changed bulk People counts, actions, and summaries to stay scoped to the currently selected files instead of the full People library.
- Changed People controls across details, bulk, and review surfaces to use the shared MediaLens themed button system, custom dropdown styling, accent-aware hover states, and light or dark mode contrast rules more consistently.
- Changed Review People face cards, separators, labels, and overlays for better contrast, cleaner spacing, stronger accent usage, and more predictable empty and no-scan states.

- Edit text directly on the canvas with reopenable text layers, themed font selection, and improved live text-edit behavior that feels closer to a traditional raster editor.
- Work with a more polished Photoshop-inspired editor featuring rulers, foreground and background color wells, stronger active-tool highlighting, refined Layers controls, and clearer dirty-document feedback.
- Open Image Editor dialogs and filter popups with consistent theming, dedicated per-filter workflows, async filter processing, and faster preview behavior on larger images.

### Added

- Added reusable inline numeric controls across the Image Editor toolbar with direct typing, horizontal drag adjustment, and mouse-wheel support.
- Added expanded automated test coverage for Image Editor menu visibility and shared numeric input behavior.
- Added direct on-canvas text editing with support for reopening existing text layers instead of always creating new ones.
- Added a themed font picker for text layers with corrected preview sizing, accent-aware selection styling, and themed popup scrollbars.
- Added Photoshop-style foreground and background color wells with a dedicated swap control and shared editor color state for paint and fill tools.
- Added Photoshop-style rulers with a View menu toggle and improved cursor or document context readouts.
- Added expanded blend-mode support, persistent layer masks, improved compositing, unrestricted layer movement, and softer hardness-aware brush rendering within the editor document model.
- Added dedicated editor-only Selection, Layers, Image, and Filter menu workflows with popup dialogs for image sizing, layer properties, and filter operations.
- Added shared themed editor dialog controls for rename, layer properties, crop, resize, and filter windows with custom dropdowns, drag-wheel numeric inputs, and accent-aware checkbox styling.
- Added async filter preview and apply execution so expensive filter work runs off the main UI thread with safer stale-preview handling.

### Changed

- Changed top-level Image Editor menu visibility handling to use proper menubar behavior instead of popup-style widgets.
- Changed Image Editor menu behavior so only one top-level menu can be active at a time, preventing overlapping or detached menus.
- Changed Image Editor Edit and View menus to hide gallery-only actions while editing, keeping bulk editors, People review actions, gallery views, and unrelated panel toggles out of the editing workspace.
- Changed View > Show Right Panel in the Image Editor to correctly control the shared right panel when it is being used as the Layers panel.
- Changed brush and paint option controls to use the same inline numeric editing style as layer opacity for more consistent interactions.
- Changed brush hardness response and stroke interpolation so softer brushes produce more natural falloff and smoother curved strokes.
- Changed filter and image-size controls to remain in menus and dialogs instead of crowding the editor toolbars.
- Changed text editing from a separate apply-style flow to direct on-canvas editing with hidden underlying text-layer rendering during live edits, reopen support, and better initialization for new text layers.

- Changed the layer opacity field from a spinbox to the shared scrub-type numeric control and applied the same editing model across brush, text, fill, filter, adjustment, and resize controls.
- Changed image editor font, blend-mode, selection-shape, fill-mode, and filter dialogs to standardize on themed custom combo boxes instead of stock Qt dropdowns.
- Changed filter dialogs so each menu action opens a dedicated filter workflow, shows immediately before preview work starts, and reports processing status inside the dialog.
- Changed filter preview and apply handling to run asynchronously, discard stale results safely, and avoid cloning the full layered document when only the active layer preview is needed.
- Changed canvas redraw behavior to cache composited editor output between invalidations and changed large filter previews to use downscaled proxy rendering for better responsiveness.
- Changed Image Editor runtime behavior to better tolerate lightweight shells and testing environments, preventing regressions when bridge settings are unavailable.

### Removed

- Removed gallery-only View modes and non-editor Edit menu actions from the Image Editor workspace.

---

## v1.4.0

### Summary

This release introduces the first beta of the new MediaLens Image Editor, bringing a Photoshop-inspired layered raster editing workspace directly into MediaLens.

- Added a new `Settings > Hotkey Shortcuts` entry for toggling slideshow loop with `Ctrl+L`.
- Added dedicated dark-theme `slideshow` and `video` SVG assets for the new native Lightbox playback pills.

### Changed

- Changed timed Lightbox slideshow playback to advance across paginated galleries, skip unsupported files between pages, and loop through the full result set instead of only the current page.
- Changed manual Lightbox next navigation to follow the same paginated cross-page behavior as autoplay slideshow advance.
- Changed Lightbox control anchoring so image, GIF, and video navigation buttons stay fixed to the viewer area instead of shifting with each file's rendered size.
- Changed image and GIF slideshow controls to match the native video slideshow pill styling while keeping the separate video play or pause control video-only.
- Changed native Lightbox video controls so slideshow, video play or pause, and mute or volume now sit together in a clearer top-left control row.
- Changed Lightbox playback pills and native mute or volume controls to use a squarer rounded-rectangle shape that better matches the rest of the viewer chrome.
- Changed native Lightbox video pointer activity handling so moving the mouse anywhere in the Lightbox, including outside the rendered video, can reveal controls again.

---

## v1.3.4

### Summary

This release overhauls the Lightbox viewing experience for images, GIFs, and videos. MediaLens now delivers a more unified slideshow workflow, cleaner controls, better theme behavior, more reliable mixed-media playback, dedicated fullscreen Lightbox mode that stays separate from the main app window state, and expanded Lightbox hotkey support.

---

## v1.2.3

### Summary

This release keeps Fast OCR repairs from downgrading a working GPU runtime. MediaLens now preserves an active Paddle GPU setup during repair and gives clearer status when repair fails instead of making the runtime look uninstalled.

### Highlights

- Fast OCR repair now protects an already-working Paddle GPU runtime from being replaced by CPU fallback.
- Paddle OCR setup now reports when the runtime is still installed after a failed repair attempt.
- CPU fallback installation now tries the package source that works for current Paddle CPU wheels before trying Paddle's CPU index.

### Changed

- Changed splash startup handling to avoid forcing an immediate Qt event pass before the main window is built.
- Changed Settings > AI to refresh lazily so opening settings no longer runs expensive status checks for every page up front.
- Changed OCR settings into clearer Tags, Descriptions, and Text OCR tabs with model status and editable prompts.
- Changed Paddle OCR status reporting to show whether GPU is actually active instead of only showing the preferred mode.
- Changed review-window OCR generation to update the OCR cell in place without reloading and re-sorting the review list.
- Changed file-tree and pinned-folder hidden-state lookups to keep rendering if a database lookup fails instead of allowing a Qt model callback to terminate the app.
- Changed Paddle OCR installation to try multiple GPU package versions before falling back to CPU with the GPU failure reason.
- Changed Paddle OCR worker startup so `auto` with GPU preference actually passes the GPU device to PaddleOCR.
- Changed Paddle OCR status so partial failed runtimes no longer appear as installed, while valid CPU fallback runtimes still do.
- Changed Paddle CPU fallback to try PyPI if Paddle's CPU package index cannot be reached.

## v1.1.35

### Summary

This release makes duplicate and similar-image review smoother and faster. The comparison panel now opens directly into the right review context, adds practical image-by-image navigation, and bulk editors feel more responsive with large selections.

### Highlights

- The comparison panel now preloads review groups and lets you move through images and groups without leaving the panel.
- Bulk tag and caption editors open large selections faster by loading thumbnails lazily.
- Comparison labels now use live file sizes, so equal-size files are no longer shown as largest or smallest winners.

### Added

- Added Previous Image and Next Image controls for both comparison slots when reviewing duplicate or similar groups.
- Added startup and reopen handling so the comparison panel can preload the current duplicate or similar group when the bottom panel is already open.
- Added disabled tooltips for comparison navigation buttons so unavailable previous or next actions explain why they cannot run.

### Changed

- Changed comparison group navigation to remember the active review group while the bottom panel is closed and resume there when reopened.
- Changed duplicate and similar review comparison setup so opening the bottom panel seeds the active group without forcing the panel to reopen after it is closed.
- Changed comparison navigation button styling, disabled states, cursors, and SVG close icons to better match the rest of MediaLens.
- Changed comparison file-size ranking to use the live file size on disk instead of stale cached scan data.
- Changed bulk tag and bulk caption editors to lazy-load thumbnails so selected-file rows render faster.
- Changed bulk Select All handling to reduce duplicate metadata refresh work and batch selected-file database reads.

### Removed

- Removed stale auto-seeding paths that could force the bottom comparison panel open again after users closed it.

---

## v1.1.34

### Summary

This release makes MediaLens more dependable when working with SVGs, bulk selections, and the details panel. SVG files now behave better across previews and Local AI, while selection and empty-state behavior is cleaner and more predictable.

### Highlights

- SVG files now preview more cleanly and can be used with Local AI tagging through automatically generated preview images.
- The details panel now clears stale tags, descriptions, and AI fields when nothing is selected.
- Multi-select behavior is more dependable, including Ctrl-click deselection from an existing selected group.

### Added

- Added SVG poster generation for Local AI so SVG files are analyzed through a raster preview while tags and descriptions still save to the original SVG record.

### Changed

- Changed SVG rendering in the details panel so previews stay sharper when the right sidebar is resized.
- Changed SVG thumbnails in the bulk tag and caption editors to use high-contrast backgrounds.
- Changed Ctrl-click gallery selection so clicking an already selected item removes it from the current selection and updates the details panel with the reduced selection.
- Changed the details-panel empty state so stale tags, descriptions, embedded metadata, and AI fields are cleared and replaced with `Select file(s) to view details.`
- Changed bulk selected-file rows to guard against deleted Qt objects during teardown and layout updates.
- Changed corrupted text glyphs in native controls to use SVG icons or source-safe separators instead of fragile encoded characters.
- Changed `main.py`, `bridge.py`, `web/app.js`, `settings.py`, and the native window code into smaller task-focused modules while preserving the existing app behavior.
- Changed JavaScript bridge helpers to tolerate missing or non-array values in more gallery and settings flows.

### Removed

- Removed duplicate Qt bridge tooltip slots that caused ambiguous overload warnings in the terminal.

---

## v1.1.33

- Added a mode switch at the top of the Bulk Editor so you can quickly move between bulk tag editing and bulk caption editing.
- Added compact selected-file cards to bulk editing, including thumbnails and editable per-file fields for the active mode.

### Changed

- Changed the Bulk Tag Editor layout to better support large selections, including a more useful selected-files view and updated bulk generation controls.
- Changed bulk caption generation to use the existing MediaLens description pipeline while presenting it as captions in the bulk workflow.
- Changed bulk editor behavior during resize so selected files in the gallery keep their multi-selection state instead of collapsing visually to one file.
- Changed gallery selection updates with the tag list open to reduce unnecessary tag-list work and improve responsiveness when moving between files.

### Removed

- Removed Common and Uncommon sections, add-to-all input, and tag-list access from the caption workflow where they did not fit description editing.

---

## v1.1.32

### Summary

This release makes Local AI much more reliable in real-world use, especially in installed builds. MediaLens now handles more image formats correctly for Gemma, keeps model selection and status more consistent, and fixes several frustrating Local AI setup and runtime edge cases.

### Highlights

- Gemma 4 is more dependable in the installed app, with several fixes for model selection, runtime launch behavior, and fallback handling.
- Local AI now handles AVIF, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, WebP, animated images, and video sources more safely by converting them to preview images before sending them to Gemma.

- Improved animated GIF lightbox rendering to avoid CPU-heavy styling that could impact playback.

---

## v1.1.29

### Summary

This release fixes local AI install and preload failures in installed builds. MediaLens now launches each model worker from its own isolated runtime path, skips model downloads when required files are already present, repairs stale InternLM support paths, and reports clearer install errors when a preload really fails.

### Highlights

- Existing local AI model files are now detected before MediaLens tries to download them again.
- Install can finish cleanly after creating the runtime even when the model files were already present.
- Local AI workers no longer inherit the packaged app's internal Python package path, preventing installed-build dependency conflicts with per-model virtual environments.
- InternLM XComposer2 can recover when its local CLIP path was previously patched to an old development model folder.
- A failed preload/download now includes a clearer process exit code, and no longer leaves a false error if the required model files are confirmed on disk.

### Changed

- Changed local AI model installation to skip the preload/download step when model files are already installed.
- Changed local AI worker startup to launch direct worker scripts from the model runtime directory instead of importing through the packaged app bundle.
- Changed local AI install completion to re-check model files after preload failures before reporting an error.
- Changed InternLM XComposer2 path repair so stale local CLIP paths are replaced with the currently configured model folder.
- Changed local AI worker failure messages to include Windows exit-code details when available.

---

## v1.1.28

### Summary

This release fixes a local AI setup failure in the v1.1.27 installer. Model installation can now proceed correctly, and setup errors show useful details in the Local AI Models window instead of only showing a generic error.

### Highlights

- Fixed local AI model installs failing immediately with an internal settings error.
- Local AI Models now shows install progress and error details directly in the setup window.
- Added a developer-only script to point dev runs and installed runs at the same local AI model folders.

### Added

- Added `scripts/use_installed_local_ai_paths.ps1` for local development machines that should share installed MediaLens AI folders.
- Added a compact install progress/error message line to the Local AI Models window.

### Changed

- Changed local AI install preload settings so MediaLens copies the selected model into the worker payload instead of mutating immutable settings.

---

## v1.1.27

### Summary

### Highlights

- Local AI Models and Status is now available from the View menu whenever you want to check model readiness.
- Each local AI model now has clearer status, size, purpose, install, and uninstall controls in one dedicated window.
- The Python bootstrap and model install checks are more reliable, so MediaLens only treats a model as installed when the needed files are actually present.

### Added

- Added an Uninstall action for installed local AI models in the Local AI Models window.
- Added clearer per-model Description, Size, and Status presentation in the Local AI Models window.
- Added hand cursors and tighter button sizing for Local AI Models actions.

### Changed

- Changed the Local AI Models window to follow the app's light or dark theme and accent color more closely.
- Changed installed model status to use a simple checkmark label instead of a bordered badge that looked too much like a button.
- Changed AI Settings to show simpler local AI model status and hide model size there, leaving size details in the Local AI Models window.
- Changed the Python bootstrap install path to use a verified NuGet Python package for more predictable first-run model setup.
- Changed model readiness checks so a runtime alone is not enough; required model files must also be present before the model appears installed.

### Removed

- Removed technical runtime, backend, and model-location wording from the user-facing AI setup surfaces.

---

## v1.1.26

### Summary

This release makes local AI model support much more dependable and flexible. MediaLens now isolates each AI model in its own worker process and runtime, so adding or testing new models is less likely to break models that already work.

### Highlights

- Gemma 4, InternLM XComposer2, and WD SwinV2 can now work side by side without sharing fragile dependency stacks.
- Description prompts now behave more naturally, with tags and starter text included only through prompt instructions instead of being forced onto the final response.
- Local AI failures and long-running generation are handled more clearly, with safer subprocess cleanup when the app closes.

### Added

- Added Gemma 4 E2B Instruct as an optional local AI model for tags and descriptions.
- Added a local AI model registry so each model can define its own worker module, runtime folder, and user-facing dropdown label.

- Added a managed Python bootstrap for local AI model installs so MediaLens can create per-model runtimes without requiring users to install Python themselves.
- Added clearer local AI model download size estimates based on the actual model files and major runtime packages.
- Added a View menu action to open Local AI Models and Status at any time.
- Added `{starter}` support for description prompts so users can place the starter text exactly where they want it.

### Changed

- Changed local AI execution so each model can run in its own virtual environment instead of sharing one dependency set.
- Changed installed builds to store optional local AI runtimes under `%APPDATA%\MediaLens\ai-runtimes` instead of the app install folder.
- Changed Generate Tags and Generate Description to open Local AI Models setup when the selected model runtime is not installed.
- Changed AI Settings model status details into separate Description, Size, Status, and Location rows.
- Changed description prompt handling so `{tags}` is opt-in; tags are only inserted when the prompt includes the `{tags}` placeholder.
- Changed `Start Description With` so it is passed to the model as an instruction instead of being prepended to the generated response.
- Changed InternLM XComposer2 loading back to the working legacy path after the Gemma integration work showed it requires a different runtime approach.
- Changed local AI progress and error handling to give clearer in-app updates during long-running generation and failures.
- Changed app shutdown handling so active local AI worker subprocesses are canceled and terminated more safely.

---

- Changed delete and hide handling in masonry view to return near the previous scroll position instead of jumping to the top.
- Changed masonry sizing to account for JPG EXIF orientation when reading image dimensions.
- Changed gallery refreshes to skip unnecessary DOM rebuilds when the visible gallery signature has not changed, reducing fast flashes during background updates.
- Changed lightbox video rendering to reduce expensive per-frame styling and improve playback performance.
- Changed AI prompt inputs in Settings to match the same input styling as the rest of the settings controls.

---

## v1.1.24

### Summary

This release fixes inconsistent Text Detection behavior and makes gallery filtering far more trustworthy and predictable. Manual scanner runs now perform real rescans, filters react instantly to overrides, and navigation controls feel more polished.

### Highlights

- Text Detection filters no longer treat weak text_likely signals as final results, relying instead on stronger and verified detection signals.
- Running Text Detection from Settings now performs a real rescan instead of finishing instantly from cached values.
- Gallery controls now behave more naturally, with pagination returning to the top and filter dropdowns collapsing when you click away.

### Added

- Added new SVG-based override switches for Text Detection and AI Detection, with clear on/off states across light and dark modes.

### Changed

- Changed effective Text Detection status to use manual overrides, verified text, and stronger text-detection signals instead of treating `text_likely` as source of truth.

- Changed Text Detection and OCR scanner eligibility so `text_likely` remains only a weak candidate signal, not a final positive result.
- Changed gallery refresh behavior so Text Detection and AI Detection manual override toggles immediately update active Text Detected, No Text Detected, AI, and Non-AI filters.
- Changed pagination so navigating to a different page scrolls the gallery back to the top.
- Changed the Filter By dropdown so it collapses when clicking or focusing outside of it.
- Changed text-filter scanning behavior to avoid the results/no-results blinking loop when filtering by Text Detected or No Text Detected.

---

## v1.1.23

### Summary

This release adds manual OCR text extraction, searchable detected text, and a new Scanners settings category, giving you much more control over text-related metadata tasks. With manual overrides, editable detected text, and background scanner controls, MediaLens makes it easier to find and manage media based on visible text.

---

## v1.1.20

### Summary

This release makes MediaLens easier to support on more machines with safer debugging-log bundles, clearer failure details, and more self-contained video tooling. It also lays the groundwork for optional support-log submission when a support endpoint is configured.

### Highlights

- Support bundles are now safer to share because they exclude private app data and redact path-like details.
- Debugging logs can be submitted from the Help menu after user consent once an upload endpoint is configured.
- Video thumbnails and probing are more reliable because packaged builds now include FFmpeg and FFprobe.

### Added

- Added a `debugging-logs` folder under `%APPDATA%\MediaLens\` for app logs, faulthandler logs, and crash reports.
- Added startup migration for existing root-level `app.log`, `faulthandler.log`, and `crash-reports` into the new `debugging-logs` folder.
- Added `Help > Create Debugging Log Bundle`, which creates a sanitized zip bundle for support.
- Added `Help > Submit Debugging Logs...`, which creates the sanitized bundle and uploads it only when a support endpoint is configured.
- Added consent, optional contact email, and optional issue notes to the debugging-log submission flow.
- Added hidden upload configuration through `MEDIALENS_DEBUG_UPLOAD_URL`, `MEDIALENS_DEBUG_UPLOAD_TOKEN`, or the matching support settings keys.
- Added a DreamHost-ready PHP upload endpoint template under `support-server/dreamhost`.
- Added DreamHost deployment instructions for a low-cost support-log submission setup.
- Added bundled `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` packaging during installer builds.

---

## v1.1.18

### Summary

This release makes installed Windows builds more dependable. MediaLens now uses a cleaner per-user app-data location and applies safer gallery rendering defaults on systems where the embedded gallery could appear black or fail to paint correctly.

### Highlights

- Fixed installed builds that could show a black gallery surface even while items were still clickable underneath.
- MediaLens now stores logs, settings, and database files under `%APPDATA%\MediaLens\` instead of the old legacy app-data naming.
- Existing installs migrate forward automatically so users keep their settings and library data.

### Added

- Duplicate and similar review now loads more smoothly, with clearer progress stages and more stable rendering.
- Selections, folder priorities, and copied tags now behave more consistently during cleanup.
- Exact image duplicates continue matching even after metadata-only edits.
- New built-in retention system gives you a safer alternative to the Recycle Bin, with restore and cleanup controls.

### Added

- Added a built-in MediaLens retention system as an alternative to the Windows Recycle Bin, with configurable retention, review, restore, and delete options.
- Added `Most metadata` to the duplicate priority order so metadata preference can be explicitly ranked alongside folder, format, and size rules.
- Added tag inheritance when copying files inside MediaLens so copied files keep the source file's app tags.

### Changed

- Moved duplicate and similar grouping, ranking, and rule logic out of `main.py` into `review_groups.py` for a cleaner review pipeline.
- Reworked duplicate and similar review rendering to build offscreen first, then reveal cards in a more stable, staged way.
- Improved duplicate and similar progress messaging so folder scanning, grouping, and rendering stages are easier to understand.
- Updated preferred folder persistence so folder priority order is retained more consistently across settings changes and scope changes.
- Changed image duplicate identity to use decoded image content instead of raw file bytes, so metadata-only image edits do not break exact duplicate grouping.

### Removed

- Removed the old in-class duplicate and similar logic copies from `main.py` after the extracted review module became the live implementation.

---

## v1.1.14

### Summary

This release makes tag-heavy cleanup much faster and easier to trust. MediaLens adds a full Tag List workspace, a rebuilt Bulk Tag Editor, and smoother multi-file tagging workflows that keep gallery filtering, selection, and tag feedback aligned.

### Highlights

- Tag List now gives you a dedicated panel for saved tag groups, quick tag filtering, drag sorting, and one-click tagging actions.
- Bulk Tag Editor is now a true separate workspace with common tags, uncommon tags, and faster select-all workflows for editing many files at once.
- Tag filtering, gallery counts, and selection behavior are now much more consistent, so you can move between parent tags and sub-tags without losing context.

### Added

- Added a resizable Tag List panel beside the right sidebar with saved tag lists, sorting modes, drag-and-drop ordering, import-from-file, and quick open and close controls.
- Added tag count buttons and tag-row filtering so the gallery can be narrowed to files using a selected tag directly from the Tag List.
- Added a dedicated Bulk Tag Editor workspace with its own tag input, common tags, uncommon tags, and select-all actions for the current gallery scope.
- Added `View` menu actions for `Show Tag List` and `Bulk Tag Editor`.
- Added empty-state and bulk-editor `Select All` buttons to speed up multi-file tagging workflows.

### Changed

- Reworked the right sidebar so Details, Bulk Tag Editor, and Tag List behave as separate workspaces while still sharing the same panel visibility and resize behavior.
- Updated Tag List actions so adding tags writes to the database immediately in both single-file and bulk workflows.
- Improved tag filtering so temporary tag scope does not overwrite the underlying gallery scope, making it much easier to switch between tags quickly.
- Improved bulk tag feedback so common and uncommon tags stay aligned with the selected files and Tag List highlighting.
- Refined selection behavior so gallery selections remain visible while working in Details, Tag List, and Bulk Tag Editor, and plain clicks return multi-selection back to a single selected file.

## v1.1.13

### Summary

This release makes large libraries easier to slice down into manageable work. MediaLens adds Smart Collections and better stackable filters for common cleanup cases, while also improving AI detection so you can trust automatic results or override them when needed.

### Highlights

- Smart Collections now give you one-click views for recent files, missing metadata, and larger files that are worth reviewing.
- Filter By now supports AI / Non-AI, No Tags, No Descriptions, and None to clear all filters.
- AI detection is more consistent across scanning, filtering, and details, and you can now manually confirm AI status when automatic metadata detection is not enough.

### Added

- Added Smart Collections for files acquired or modified in the last 7, 14, or 30 days.
- Added Smart Collections for `No Tags`, `No Description`, and files larger than `3 MB`, `10 MB`, `25 MB`, `100 MB`, and `1 GB`.
- Added stackable `No Tags` and `No Description` filters under `Filter By` so metadata cleanup can be scoped alongside other filters.
- Added stackable `AI Generated` and `Non-AI` filters based on the stored AI detection decision.
- Added a `User Confirmed AI` override in the details panel so manual AI decisions can take priority over automatic detection when needed.

### Changed

- Changed AI filtering to rely on one canonical stored AI decision instead of re-inferring AI state separately in multiple places.
- Improved scanning and metadata persistence so supported files now get an explicit AI detection result saved instead of leaving the field blank.
- Improved AI metadata parsing so SillyTavern-style metadata is recognized more reliably and user comments no longer count as AI evidence by themselves.
- Updated the details panel so core AI metadata fields, including `AI Tool / Source`, can be edited and saved back to the database.
- Replaced the native file-menu settings cog with a themed SVG icon that stays black in light mode and white in dark mode.
- Simplified `Filter By` so a single `None` option clears all groups while empty groups continue to behave implicitly as no filter.
- Fixed the file tree `Collapse All` action so it no longer instantly re-expands.

### Removed

- Removed the old `Start Collapsed in Details Panel` metadata setting, since the details panel no longer supports that behavior.

---

## v1.1.12

- Added a sticky review message and live summary cards for Keep, Delete, and Potential Savings based on the current checked selections.
- Added matching trashcan actions and delete-state syncing in the comparison panel so review actions stay consistent across both workflows.

### Changed

- Changed exact duplicate review so `Identical` is shown in place of `Best Overall` across duplicate groups, mixed duplicate-and-similar groups, and the comparison panel.
- Improved comparison winner logic so `Best in Comparison` follows `Best Overall` when files are effectively tied, with clearer winner labels only when there is a real difference.
- Restored and aligned duplicate scoring labels such as `Most metadata` so they appear more consistently in duplicate review and comparison.
- Updated duplicate-review and comparison trash buttons to use matching icon styling, hover states, and theme-aware colors.
- Renamed and refined the duplicate-review stats cards for clearer wording and better responsive behavior at smaller window sizes.
- Fixed Advanced Search duration and file-size unit selectors.

---

## v1.0.22

### Added

- **Bottom AI Panel Shell**: Added a new hideable and resizable bottom panel with persisted visibility and size so the upcoming AI chat area has a dedicated place in the layout.
- **Explorer-Style Address Bar**: Replaced the simple selected-folder label with a full Windows Explorer-style address bar that shows the full path as clickable breadcrumbs.
- **Breadcrumb Folder Menus**: Added dropdown chevrons between breadcrumb segments and at the end of the current path so nearby folders can be opened directly from the address bar.

### Changed

- **Navigation Responsiveness**: Moved breadcrumb folder enumeration, gallery counts, and gallery listing requests off the UI thread so folder navigation is less likely to freeze the app.
- **Tree Sync Scheduling**: Changed native tree synchronization so folder navigation updates the selected folder first and coalesces heavier tree sync work behind a deferred timer instead of doing it immediately on every navigation.
- **Address Bar Interaction**: Added editable-path mode plus keyboard navigation and lazy-expanding flyout menus so the address bar behaves much closer to Windows Explorer.
- **Header Wrapping**: Updated the header layout so pagination drops below the address bar on narrower widths instead of overlapping it.
- **Release Build Safety**: Hardened the release build flow to catch stale packaged artifacts before producing an installer and kept `setup.cfg` versioning in sync during version bumps.

---

## v1.0.21

### Added

- **Explorer-Style Folder Navigation**: Added `Back`, `Up`, `Forward`, and `Refresh` controls beside the selected-folder readout for faster folder browsing.

### Changed

- **Context Menu Placement**: Refined right-click menu positioning so menus stay fully visible on screen instead of getting clipped near the bottom or edges.
- **Native Drag Preview Overhaul**: Replaced the Windows shell drag preview with a native in-app drag stack that keeps original aspect ratios, supports larger previews, and positions the preview/tooltip stack cleanly beside the cursor.
- **Multi-Item Drag Stacks**: Multi-select drags now show overlapping preview thumbnails so stacked drags communicate that multiple files are moving or copying.
- **Left Tree Navigation Behavior**: Restored the file tree so normal folder navigation highlights subfolders without re-rooting the tree unexpectedly.

---

## v1.0.20

### Added

- **Metadata Detail Group Headings**: Added `General`, `Camera`, and `AI` section headings to the single-item metadata details panel so dense metadata is easier to scan.

### Changed

- **Gallery Folder Drag and Drop**: Fixed dragging files from the gallery into folder cards shown inside the gallery, while preserving cancel behavior when dropping back on the same item or gallery background.
- **Timeline Polish Pass**: Added active/visible/dim anchor emphasis, corrected the bottom-of-gallery anchor edge case, made the timeline resize against the visible gallery viewport, improved its final positioning, and cleaned up the rounded shell rendering.
- **Metadata Panel Cleanup**: Removed unwanted Qt label indentation/left rules from metadata labels and headings, kept detail-only group headers out of bulk/empty states, and restyled `Clear Tags From DB` to match the other bulk tag editor actions.
- **Glassmorphism Removal**: Removed the appearance toggle and remaining blur/translucency paths so the header, lightbox, and other surfaces render fully opaque without flicker around animated GIFs and videos.
- **Sidebar Divider Stability**: Refined the native sidebar splitter/divider rendering so borders and resize hover states render crisply instead of appearing too thin or flickering.

### Removed

- **Glassmorphism Setting**: Removed the `Enable glassmorphism` appearance option and its remaining runtime wiring.

---

## v1.0.19

### Added

- **What's New Release Notes**: The `What's New` dialog now shows the polished `ReleaseNotes.md` summary first, followed by the full bundled changelog for users who want the detailed breakdown.
- **Timeline Navigation Arrows**: Added dedicated up/down controls to the timeline rail so dense timelines more clearly communicate that extra dates are available above or below the current viewport.

### Changed

- **Timeline Navigation Overhaul**: Rebuilt the grouped-date timeline to use one anchor per real date header, unified tooltip behavior, smoother drag and wheel scrubbing, a hybrid viewported anchor rail for dense timelines, and granularity-specific sizing for day, month, and year modes.
- **Infinite Scroll Policy**: Switched grouped-date non-masonry views plus `List`, `Details`, `Content`, `Small Grid`, and `Medium Grid` to infinite scroll so timeline navigation and long-form browsing are no longer broken up by pagination.
- **Header Responsiveness**: Moved the panel toggle and settings buttons beside Search and reworked the header layout so the controls wrap more cleanly on narrower widths instead of clipping off the right edge.
- **Bundled Help Content**: Packaged `SEARCH_SYNTAX.md` and `ReleaseNotes.md` with installed builds so help/release dialogs work outside the raw development environment.
- **Startup Folder Settings**: Corrected startup-folder settings state so the Browse button and related controls stay enabled/disabled based on the real `restore_last` setting.

---

## v1.0.18

### Changed

- **Details Header Layout**: Refined regular and grouped Details header spacing, sticky positioning, separator styling, and scroll-state behavior so both modes align cleanly without visible jumps or header gaps.
- **Grouped Details Columns**: Fixed grouped-by-date Details mode so the shared resizable header stays aligned with filenames, folders, sizes, and other row data below it while resizing.
- **Sidebar Width Persistence**: Corrected sidebar state persistence so reopening panels restores their previous usable widths instead of saving and restoring zero-width sidebars.
- **WebEngine Startup Stability**: Deferred the initial WebEngine background-color setup until after the event loop starts, avoiding native startup aborts seen on some installed Windows machines.

---

## v1.0.17

### Added

- **Crash Diagnostics**: Added local crash-report generation, `faulthandler` logging, and Help menu actions to create a diagnostic report or open the crash-report folder for troubleshooting installed builds on other machines.

### Changed

- **Packaged Runtime Stability**: Hardened packaged startup/runtime behavior by normalizing AI metadata values before JSON persistence, preventing scan-time failures from non-serializable EXIF values like Pillow `IFDRational`.
- **Details Panel States**: Updated the right sidebar so it shows a true empty-state prompt when nothing is selected and switches to a dedicated bulk tag editor when multiple files are selected.
- **Bulk Tag Editing**: Refined bulk tag save/embed behavior so entered tags append to existing DB and embedded file tags instead of replacing them.

---

## v1.0.16

### Changed

- **Grouped Details View**: Fixed grouped Details mode so only one sticky column header appears at the top, date groups collapse correctly, sticky date headers sit beneath the Details header, and the header seam no longer exposes scrolling content behind it.
- **List Context Menu**: Refined list-view context menu layering so the custom right-click menu reliably appears above gallery rows instead of being visually overlapped by list items.
- **Fresh Install Bootstrap**: Updated the packaged database initialization flow to bundle and load the SQL schema correctly in installed builds, preventing first-run launch failures caused by missing `app\\mediamanager\\db` resources.

---

## v1.0.15

### Added

- **Date Grouping**: Added `Group By Date` across gallery views with date headers, collapsible sections, and a right-side jump/scrub timeline.
- **Date Metadata Fields**: Added `Date Taken`, `Date Acquired`, `Date Created`, and `Date Modified` to metadata settings and the Details sidebar for images, GIFs, and videos.

### Changed

- **Timeline UI**: Refined the timeline scrubber layout, spacing, padding, coloring, and docked sizing so it no longer overlaps the gallery and behaves predictably while resizing.
- **Metadata Dates**: Updated scanning, import, save, and embed flows to extract and persist filesystem dates plus EXIF/XMP-style taken/acquired dates, and made `Date Taken` and `Date Acquired` editable in the sidebar.
- **Date Labels**: Renamed date labels throughout the app for consistency with Windows Properties and the Details/settings panels.

---

## v1.0.14

### Changed

- **Installer Build**: Updated the packaged Windows app so background media scanning and related `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` work no longer opens console windows while scanning folders.

---

## v1.0.7

### Changed in v1.0.7

- **Video Player Sizing Fix**: Addressed a race condition that caused in-place gallery videos to occasionally play at an incorrect, minimized size.
- **Lightbox Styling Refinements**: Fixed an issue where hovering over the lightbox previous/next navigation buttons caused them to shift downward. They now scale up smoothly in place.
- **Mute Default Restored**: Fixed a bug where in-place videos would sometimes start with sound. Videos are properly muted by default again.

## v1.0.6

### Added in v1.0.6

- **Accent Color on Video Sliders**: Volume and seek bar sliders in the video overlay now use the user's selected accent color from Settings.

- **Video Click Behavior**: Clicking the video frame no longer pauses playback; only the dedicated Pause button does.

- **Fixed Auto-Update:** Auto-Update now uses RedirectPolicyAttribute with NoLessSafeRedirectPolicy which properly follows the redirects that github uses for releases.

### Removed in v1.0.6
