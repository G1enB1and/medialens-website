# Change Log

## v1.2.10 (Current)

### Summary

This release focuses on responsiveness in tag filtering, bulk editing, duplicate review, and comparison workflows. MediaLens now shows visible gallery updates sooner, avoids several unnecessary UI refresh passes, and recovers more reliably from panel resizing during review.

### Highlights

- Filter by tags with faster gallery updates and less blocking work from the tag list.
- Review duplicates and similar files without the gallery waiting indefinitely behind off-screen loading work.
- Use bulk tag and description editors with clearer per-file Save controls and more stable responsive row layouts.

### Added

- Added per-file Save Tags buttons in the bulk Tags editor.
- Added per-file Save buttons beside Generate Description in the bulk Descriptions editor.
- Added targeted performance logging around gallery refreshes, bulk editor rebuilds, metadata selection, and layout syncs.
- Added short-lived gallery count caching and local AI status caching so repeated refreshes can avoid expensive checks.

### Changed

- Changed typed tag edits so they save only when the user clicks Save instead of auto-saving after input debounce.
- Changed tag filtering so the gallery and bulk editor update before slower tag-list state refresh work.
- Changed tag scope counts to update in place and reuse cached scope data when the active scope has not changed.
- Changed bulk selected-file rows to avoid redundant full layout passes when width, row count, and orientation are unchanged.
- Changed bulk row action button sizing so longer labels keep enough space before shorter Save buttons borrow equal width.
- Changed bulk tag and description row buttons to use distinct object names and styling independent of single-file metadata visibility settings.
- Changed duplicate and similar review loading so review results render directly instead of waiting for detached staged cards.
- Changed comparison panel show and hide handling to notify the gallery after splitter resizing so WebEngine repaints without requiring a manual resize.
- Changed startup dark-mode handling so the gallery background is dark before the WebEngine page finishes loading.
- Changed settings, local AI status checks, scan cache invalidation, and settings-triggered gallery refreshes to do less broad repeated work.

## v1.2.9

### Summary

This release expands folder workflows, collection behavior, and file handling while making gallery video playback and sorting more dependable. MediaLens now handles more real-world library layouts with less unnecessary scanning, smoother playback behavior, and clearer fallback handling.

### Highlights

- Drag folders between the gallery, file tree, pinned folders, collections, and external destinations with clearer move, copy, and pin behavior.
- Keep collections live with folder sources, optional nested file inclusion, and MediaLens recycle bin recovery for deleted folders and file types.
- Browse and sort larger galleries more smoothly, including WebM playback fixes and lightweight display for non-media files when enabled.

### Added

- Added folder drag-and-drop support for gallery folders, file tree destinations, pinned folders, collections, and Windows File Explorer destinations.
- Added support for collections that include live folder sources instead of only copied file snapshots.
- Added MediaLens recycle bin support for deleted folders and all file types that MediaLens can delete.
- Added a General setting to switch between showing all file types and showing media files only, with lightweight icons for unsupported file types.
- Added Local AI Models VRAM fit indicators, recommended-model emphasis, and a fit message below the model list.

### Changed

- Changed drag-and-drop tooltips for folders, pinned folders, collections, invalid destinations, and same-destination copy behavior.
- Changed folder copy and move refresh handling to use narrower cache invalidation instead of broad app-wide cache clearing where possible.
- Changed collections so folder display and Include nested files behavior match normal gallery folder behavior.
- Changed unsupported file handling so non-media files avoid expensive metadata, thumbnail, OCR, and AI processing when shown.
- Changed the Local AI Models window so light mode styling covers the model list and related controls more consistently.
- Changed delete confirmation dialogs for folders and collections to use MediaLens themed titles, accent colors, and button styling.
- Changed the empty no-folder gallery message so it spans the gallery, uses bold text, and explains how to pick a folder.
- Changed in-place gallery video playback to clear stale frames when switching videos.
- Changed WebM handling so playback controls appear correctly, invalid tiny dimensions no longer collapse masonry cards, and in-place playback sizing is more stable.
- Changed sort-only gallery refreshes so they skip unnecessary scan and count work.

- Changed theme coverage for settings, comparison, OCR review, dialogs, context menus, selection colors, no-text icons, and bulk thumbnail borders.
- Changed sidebar section size restore so Pinned Folders keeps a usable height across sessions and is protected from being squeezed by the file tree.
- Changed Details panel tag edits to save through the tag-only path instead of the full save-all handler.
- Changed bulk editor mode buttons to use the pointing-hand cursor.
- Changed gallery handling for unsupported or corrupt image files so previews and cards show a clear unavailable state.

---

## v1.2.7

### Summary

This release focuses on making Paddle OCR setup recover cleanly when a previous install attempt failed.

- Added support for browsing other Windows drives from the folder tree.
- Added Paddle OCR status details for CPU Paddle, GPU Paddle, PaddleOCR, and detected GPU device count.

### Changed

- Changed startup folder handling so new installs do not automatically open and scan a folder until the user chooses one.
- Changed Local AI recommended settings so they select the recommended Gemma profile without starting a model download.
- Changed Gemma recommendation logic so systems without detected NVIDIA VRAM choose the smallest profile instead of the largest profile.
- Changed background scanning to back off CPU usage so Windows and other apps remain more responsive during large scans.
- Changed Paddle OCR runtime repair to clear stale Paddle package files before GPU activation.
- Changed Paddle OCR GPU validation to use a focused Paddle core probe instead of a broader PaddleOCR import during install checks.
- Changed Paddle OCR repair so compatible NVIDIA systems with GPU preference do not silently settle on CPU fallback after a GPU install failure.
- Changed Paddle OCR worker startup so bundled NVIDIA package DLL folders are added to the runtime path before OCR starts.

---

## v1.2.5

### Summary

This release makes everyday navigation and setup feel cleaner in MediaLens. Pinned folders can now be reordered directly, settings opens without flashing helper windows, and OCR runtime repair is more resilient when a previous install is stale.

### Highlights

- Reorder Pinned Folders by dragging them into the order you prefer.
- Open Settings with fewer distracting helper-window flashes from AI runtime checks.
- Repair Paddle OCR runtimes more reliably when an old or broken install is in the way.

### Added

- Added drag-and-drop sorting for Pinned Folders in the left sidebar.

### Changed

- Changed the Pinned Folders drag preview to show the styled row background, border, folder icon, folder name, and pin icon.
- Changed AI runtime and GPU probe subprocesses so they start hidden on Windows when status checks run from Settings.
- Changed shutdown handling for async AI status, media listing, media count, and child-folder callbacks so late results do not touch a deleted Bridge object.
- Changed Paddle OCR reinstall behavior to recreate stale runtimes before reinstalling and retry GPU activation after a failed runtime probe.

---

## v1.2.4

### Summary

This release makes detailed image review easier in MediaLens. OCR Review and the main image lightbox now support pan and zoom, while comparison workflows keep context, actions, and layout more stable as you move through groups.

### Highlights

- OCR Review images now support cursor-centered zoom and drag panning for precise text inspection.
- Image lightbox viewing now supports the same scrollwheel zoom and drag panning workflow.
- Comparison review navigation keeps group context, action controls, and panel sizing more predictable.

- Changed single-group comparison review actions to stay on a bottom action row and remain clipped cleanly during resize.
- Changed comparison review navigation to preserve the comparison panel height and restore group scroll position after closing comparison.
- Changed comparison group navigation to account for the sticky stats header so selected groups land more consistently.
- Changed comparison panel image loading and browse text sizing to be more stable.

---

## v1.2.3

### Summary

This release keeps Fast OCR repairs from downgrading a working GPU runtime. MediaLens now preserves an active Paddle GPU setup during repair and gives clearer status when repair fails instead of making the runtime look uninstalled.

### Highlights

- Fast OCR repair now protects an already-working Paddle GPU runtime from being replaced by CPU fallback.
- Paddle OCR setup now reports when the runtime is still installed after a failed repair attempt.
- CPU fallback installation now tries the package source that works for current Paddle CPU wheels before trying Paddle's CPU index.

### Changed

- Changed Paddle OCR repair so an existing GPU-active runtime is not removed before the replacement GPU package is proven usable.
- Changed Paddle OCR repair so CPU fallback is skipped when it would downgrade an existing GPU-active runtime.
- Changed Paddle OCR install failure handling to re-check the existing runtime before reporting it as not installed.
- Changed Paddle CPU fallback install order to try PyPI before Paddle's CPU package index.

---

## v1.2.2

- Added installer uninstall prompts for database, settings, recycle-bin retention data, thumbnails, AI models, AI runtimes, debug logs, import backups, legacy files, and other app-data.
- Added startup update diagnostics before the app bridge initializes.

### Changed

- Changed startup update dialogs so they are parented to the splash screen instead of appearing as stray top-level windows.
- Changed startup update checks to log failures and fall back to the GitHub latest-release API when the raw version check fails.
- Changed update-check setting synchronization so changes apply immediately.
- Changed library import so the main database is restored as the selected backup while supported app-data categories can merge or replace independently.
- Changed interactive uninstall cleanup so app-data files are removed unless the user explicitly selects the matching category to keep.

### Removed

- Removed active carry-forward of old MediaManagerX legacy files from the library backup format.

---

## v1.2.1

### Removed

- Removed the duplicate Paddle Runtime Install/Repair button from Settings > AI > Text and OCR.

---

## v1.1.37

### Summary

This release makes Paddle OCR setup clearer and more reliable, especially on systems with NVIDIA GPUs. MediaLens now avoids misleading install/status states and gives developers a faster way to test installed-runtime behavior without rebuilding.

### Highlights

- Paddle OCR setup is more transparent about whether GPU is active, CPU fallback is in use, or repair is needed.
- AI Models status no longer looks like it starts installs while it is only checking runtimes.
- Source runs now use installed AI runtime paths by default, making Paddle fixes faster to test before packaging.

### Added

- Added installed-build AI runtime path behavior to `python run.py` dev launches.
- Added a `MEDIALENS_USE_INSTALLED_AI_PATHS=1` switch for source runs that should use AppData AI runtime and model paths.

### Changed

- Changed Paddle OCR installation so PaddleOCR dependency resolution cannot replace the final selected GPU runtime with CPU Paddle.
- Changed Paddle OCR installation to check and repair pip without upgrading pip itself on every install.
- Changed Paddle OCR GPU detection to try absolute `nvidia-smi` paths and report the attempted detection failures.
- Changed Paddle OCR status details to distinguish installing, checking, NVIDIA detected but inactive, valid CPU fallback, and runtime probe errors.
- Changed Paddle status so CPU-only Paddle on a detected NVIDIA GPU is shown as a repairable GPU error, not a clean install.
- Changed the Paddle install button on the AI Models status page to wait for install progress signals instead of immediately refreshing back to a not-installed probe result.
- Changed AI Models status refreshes to show `Checking` instead of `Installing` while probing runtimes.
- Changed the AI Models status expand and collapse controls to use theme-appropriate SVG arrows instead of text characters.
- Changed model install status updates so other model rows stay collapsed unless explicitly expanded.
- Changed the gallery loading message to remove encoded text.

### Removed

- Removed no user-facing features in this release.

---

## v1.1.36

### Highlights

- Startup is more reliable on affected Windows installs that previously crashed just after the splash screen.
- OCR setup is easier to review with clearer Fast OCR, AI OCR, and Paddle runtime status.
- Review workflows now make it faster to generate OCR text and mark files as having no text.
- Paddle OCR installation now tries multiple GPU package versions first, then falls back to CPU with a clear reason when GPU is unavailable or unusable.

### Added

- Added Paddle OCR to the Local AI Models status dialog with status, progress, install, uninstall, and delete-cache controls.
- Added OCR scanner scope options for processing either files marked as text detected or all files in scope.
- Added Fast OCR and AI OCR generate buttons to the OCR review workflow.
- Added a No Text review action that clears the selected OCR winner and marks the file as no text detected.

### Changed

- Changed Windows frozen builds to keep WebEngine's default page during startup, avoiding a native crash path seen on some installed systems.
- Changed splash startup handling to avoid forcing an immediate Qt event pass before the main window is built.
- Changed Settings > AI to refresh lazily so opening settings no longer runs expensive status checks for every page up front.
- Changed OCR settings into clearer Tags, Descriptions, and Text OCR tabs with model status and editable prompts.
- Changed Paddle OCR status reporting to show whether GPU is actually active instead of only showing the preferred mode.
- Changed review-window OCR generation to update the OCR cell in place without reloading and re-sorting the review list.
- Changed file-tree and pinned-folder hidden-state lookups to keep rendering if a database lookup fails instead of allowing a Qt model callback to terminate the app.
- Changed Paddle OCR installation to try multiple GPU package versions before falling back to CPU with the GPU failure reason.
- Changed Paddle OCR worker startup so `auto` with GPU preference actually passes the GPU device to PaddleOCR.
- Changed Paddle OCR status so partial failed runtimes no longer appear as installed, while valid CPU fallback runtimes still do.
- Changed Paddle CPU fallback to try PyPI if Paddle's CPU package index cannot be reached.

### Removed

- Removed OCR Accurate, leaving Fast OCR through Paddle and AI OCR through Gemma 4.

---

## v1.1.35

### Summary

This release makes duplicate and similar-image review smoother and faster. The comparison panel now opens directly into the right review context, adds practical image-by-image navigation, and bulk editors feel more responsive with large selections.

### Highlights

- The comparison panel now preloads review groups and lets you move through images and groups without leaving the panel.
- Bulk tag and caption editors open large selections faster by loading thumbnails lazily.
- Comparison labels now use live file sizes, so equal-size files are no longer shown as largest or smallest winners.

### Added

- Added Previous Image and Next Image controls for both comparison slots when reviewing duplicate or similar groups.
- Added startup and reopen handling so the comparison panel can preload the current duplicate or similar group when the bottom panel is already open.
- Added disabled tooltips for comparison navigation buttons so unavailable previous or next actions explain why they cannot run.

### Changed

- Changed comparison group navigation to remember the active review group while the bottom panel is closed and resume there when reopened.
- Changed duplicate and similar review comparison setup so opening the bottom panel seeds the active group without forcing the panel to reopen after it is closed.
- Changed comparison navigation button styling, disabled states, cursors, and SVG close icons to better match the rest of MediaLens.
- Changed comparison file-size ranking to use the live file size on disk instead of stale cached scan data.
- Changed bulk tag and bulk caption editors to lazy-load thumbnails so selected-file rows render faster.
- Changed bulk Select All handling to reduce duplicate metadata refresh work and batch selected-file database reads.

### Removed

- Removed stale auto-seeding paths that could force the bottom comparison panel open again after users closed it.

---

## v1.1.34

### Summary

This release makes MediaLens more dependable when working with SVGs, bulk selections, and the details panel. SVG files now behave better across previews and Local AI, while selection and empty-state behavior is cleaner and more predictable.

### Highlights

- SVG files now preview more cleanly and can be used with Local AI tagging through automatically generated preview images.
- The details panel now clears stale tags, descriptions, and AI fields when nothing is selected.
- Multi-select behavior is more dependable, including Ctrl-click deselection from an existing selected group.

### Added

- Added SVG poster generation for Local AI so SVG files are analyzed through a raster preview while tags and descriptions still save to the original SVG record.

### Changed

- Changed SVG rendering in the details panel so previews stay sharper when the right sidebar is resized.
- Changed SVG thumbnails in the bulk tag and caption editors to use high-contrast backgrounds.
- Changed Ctrl-click gallery selection so clicking an already selected item removes it from the current selection and updates the details panel with the reduced selection.
- Changed the details-panel empty state so stale tags, descriptions, embedded metadata, and AI fields are cleared and replaced with `Select file(s) to view details.`
- Changed bulk selected-file rows to guard against deleted Qt objects during teardown and layout updates.
- Changed corrupted text glyphs in native controls to use SVG icons or source-safe separators instead of fragile encoded characters.
- Changed `main.py`, `bridge.py`, `web/app.js`, `settings.py`, and the native window code into smaller task-focused modules while preserving the existing app behavior.
- Changed JavaScript bridge helpers to tolerate missing or non-array values in more gallery and settings flows.

### Removed

- Removed duplicate Qt bridge tooltip slots that caused ambiguous overload warnings in the terminal.

---

## v1.1.33

### Summary

- Changed bulk caption generation to use the existing MediaLens description pipeline while presenting it as captions in the bulk workflow.
- Changed bulk editor behavior during resize so selected files in the gallery keep their multi-selection state instead of collapsing visually to one file.
- Changed gallery selection updates with the tag list open to reduce unnecessary tag-list work and improve responsiveness when moving between files.

### Removed

- Removed Common and Uncommon sections, add-to-all input, and tag-list access from the caption workflow where they did not fit description editing.

---

## v1.1.32

### Summary

This release makes Local AI much more reliable in real-world use, especially in installed builds. MediaLens now handles more image formats correctly for Gemma, keeps model selection and status more consistent, and fixes several frustrating Local AI setup and runtime edge cases.

### Highlights

- Gemma 4 is more dependable in the installed app, with several fixes for model selection, runtime launch behavior, and fallback handling.
- Local AI now handles AVIF, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, WebP, animated images, and video sources more safely by converting them to preview images before sending them to Gemma.
- The Local AI setup and status experience is clearer, with improved model syncing, copyable status text, and simpler advanced versus recommended flows.

### Added

- Added stronger Gemma launch diagnostics in worker logs to make installed-build failures easier to trace.
- Added broader retry and fallback handling for Gemma GGUF launches, including a true CPU-offload fallback path when GPU startup fails.
- Added more complete Gemma sub-model syncing between settings UI, status views, and active runtime payloads.

### Changed

- Changed Local AI source handling so Gemma uses generated preview images for AVIF, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, WebP, animated images, and videos instead of sending unsupported originals to llama.cpp.
- Changed Gemma GGUF launch behavior in installed builds to better isolate subprocess state inherited from the packaged app.
- Changed Gemma profile selection so the selected downloaded sub-model consistently becomes the active runtime model instead of only updating UI state.
- Changed Local AI troubleshooting surfaces so important status and error text remains easier to copy and verify.
- Changed several Local AI model-management flows to behave more predictably when switching between downloaded Gemma variants.

### Removed

- Removed a parser-sensitive tag filter expression that could fail on stricter Python parsing paths.

---

## v1.1.31

### Summary

---

## v1.1.30

### Summary

This release makes large folders feel significantly faster and more responsive during scanning. MediaLens now avoids unnecessary work by detecting changes more efficiently, prioritizing visible content, and resuming scans more intelligently.

### Highlights

- Large folders now spend far less time checking for changes before the gallery becomes usable.
- Visible media is scanned first, so on-screen content loads and updates sooner.
- Scans resume more gracefully after interruptions, reducing wasted work.

### Added

- Added checkpoint-based scan resume so interrupted scans continue from prior progress instead of restarting.

### Changed

- Reworked scan evaluation to use a single-pass change detection instead of multiple full-folder checks.
- Optimized change detection by comparing against preloaded in-memory data instead of per-file database queries.
- Limited deep scanning to only files that actually changed instead of reprocessing entire folders.
- Prioritized currently visible gallery items during scanning.
- Switched to thread-local SQLite connections to eliminate cross-thread scanner errors.
- Improved animated GIF lightbox rendering to avoid CPU-heavy styling that could impact playback.

---

## v1.1.29

### Summary

This release fixes local AI install and preload failures in installed builds. MediaLens now launches each model worker from its own isolated runtime path, skips model downloads when required files are already present, repairs stale InternLM support paths, and reports clearer install errors when a preload really fails.

### Highlights

- Existing local AI model files are now detected before MediaLens tries to download them again.
- Install can finish cleanly after creating the runtime even when the model files were already present.
- Local AI workers no longer inherit the packaged app's internal Python package path, preventing installed-build dependency conflicts with per-model virtual environments.
- InternLM XComposer2 can recover when its local CLIP path was previously patched to an old development model folder.
- A failed preload/download now includes a clearer process exit code, and no longer leaves a false error if the required model files are confirmed on disk.

### Changed

- Changed local AI model installation to skip the preload/download step when model files are already installed.
- Changed local AI worker startup to launch direct worker scripts from the model runtime directory instead of importing through the packaged app bundle.
- Changed local AI install completion to re-check model files after preload failures before reporting an error.
- Changed InternLM XComposer2 path repair so stale local CLIP paths are replaced with the currently configured model folder.
- Changed local AI worker failure messages to include Windows exit-code details when available.

---

## v1.1.28

### Summary

This release fixes a local AI setup failure in the v1.1.27 installer. Model installation can now proceed correctly, and setup errors show useful details in the Local AI Models window instead of only showing a generic error.

### Highlights

- Fixed local AI model installs failing immediately with an internal settings error.
- Local AI Models now shows install progress and error details directly in the setup window.
- Added a developer-only script to point dev runs and installed runs at the same local AI model folders.

### Added

- Added `scripts/use_installed_local_ai_paths.ps1` for local development machines that should share installed MediaLens AI folders.
- Added a compact install progress/error message line to the Local AI Models window.

### Changed

- Changed local AI install preload settings so MediaLens copies the selected model into the worker payload instead of mutating immutable settings.

---

## v1.1.27

### Summary

This release makes local AI setup easier to understand and manage. MediaLens now gives clearer model install status, simpler setup wording, and direct install or uninstall controls without exposing backend details users do not need.

### Highlights

- Local AI Models and Status is now available from the View menu whenever you want to check model readiness.
- Each local AI model now has clearer status, size, purpose, install, and uninstall controls in one dedicated window.
- The Python bootstrap and model install checks are more reliable, so MediaLens only treats a model as installed when the needed files are actually present.

### Added

- Added an Uninstall action for installed local AI models in the Local AI Models window.
- Added clearer per-model Description, Size, and Status presentation in the Local AI Models window.
- Added hand cursors and tighter button sizing for Local AI Models actions.

### Changed

- Changed the Local AI Models window to follow the app's light or dark theme and accent color more closely.
- Changed installed model status to use a simple checkmark label instead of a bordered badge that looked too much like a button.
- Changed AI Settings to show simpler local AI model status and hide model size there, leaving size details in the Local AI Models window.
- Changed the Python bootstrap install path to use a verified NuGet Python package for more predictable first-run model setup.
- Changed model readiness checks so a runtime alone is not enough; required model files must also be present before the model appears installed.

### Removed

- Removed technical runtime, backend, and model-location wording from the user-facing AI setup surfaces.

---

## v1.1.26

### Summary

This release makes local AI model support much more dependable and flexible. MediaLens now isolates each AI model in its own worker process and runtime, so adding or testing new models is less likely to break models that already work.

### Highlights

- Gemma 4, InternLM XComposer2, and WD SwinV2 can now work side by side without sharing fragile dependency stacks.
- Description prompts now behave more naturally, with tags and starter text included only through prompt instructions instead of being forced onto the final response.
- Local AI failures and long-running generation are handled more clearly, with safer subprocess cleanup when the app closes.

### Added

- Added Gemma 4 E2B Instruct as an optional local AI model for tags and descriptions.
- Added a local AI model registry so each model can define its own worker module, runtime folder, and user-facing dropdown label.
- Added separate worker subprocess entry points for WD SwinV2 tag generation and InternLM XComposer2 description generation.
- Added separate optional dependency files for WD SwinV2, InternLM XComposer2, and Gemma 4 runtimes.
- Added AI settings status for the selected tag and description models, including an install action when the model runtime is missing.
- Added a Local AI Models setup dialog that appears after installing or updating MediaLens and shows install status for each optional model runtime.
- Added a managed Python bootstrap for local AI model installs so MediaLens can create per-model runtimes without requiring users to install Python themselves.
- Added clearer local AI model download size estimates based on the actual model files and major runtime packages.
- Added a View menu action to open Local AI Models and Status at any time.
- Added `{starter}` support for description prompts so users can place the starter text exactly where they want it.

### Changed

- Changed local AI execution so each model can run in its own virtual environment instead of sharing one dependency set.
- Changed installed builds to store optional local AI runtimes under `%APPDATA%\MediaLens\ai-runtimes` instead of the app install folder.
- Changed Generate Tags and Generate Description to open Local AI Models setup when the selected model runtime is not installed.
- Changed AI Settings model status details into separate Description, Size, Status, and Location rows.
- Changed description prompt handling so `{tags}` is opt-in; tags are only inserted when the prompt includes the `{tags}` placeholder.
- Changed `Start Description With` so it is passed to the model as an instruction instead of being prepended to the generated response.
- Changed InternLM XComposer2 loading back to the working legacy path after the Gemma integration work showed it requires a different runtime approach.
- Changed local AI progress and error handling to give clearer in-app updates during long-running generation and failures.
- Changed app shutdown handling so active local AI worker subprocesses are canceled and terminated more safely.

---

- Added Union Merge as the default tag write mode so generated tags append without duplicates.
- Added a scrollable multiline Tags editor in the Details panel.

### Changed

- Changed random sorting to assign each media path a session-stable random rank that resets only when the app starts or randomize is enabled again.
- Changed delete and hide handling in masonry view to return near the previous scroll position instead of jumping to the top.
- Changed masonry sizing to account for JPG EXIF orientation when reading image dimensions.
- Changed gallery refreshes to skip unnecessary DOM rebuilds when the visible gallery signature has not changed, reducing fast flashes during background updates.
- Changed lightbox video rendering to reduce expensive per-frame styling and improve playback performance.
- Changed AI prompt inputs in Settings to match the same input styling as the rest of the settings controls.

---

## v1.1.24

### Summary

This release fixes inconsistent Text Detection behavior and makes gallery filtering far more trustworthy and predictable. Manual scanner runs now perform real rescans, filters react instantly to overrides, and navigation controls feel more polished.

### Highlights

- Text Detection filters no longer treat weak text_likely signals as final results, relying instead on stronger and verified detection signals.
- Running Text Detection from Settings now performs a real rescan instead of finishing instantly from cached values.

- Changed pagination so navigating to a different page scrolls the gallery back to the top.
- Changed the Filter By dropdown so it collapses when clicking or focusing outside of it.
- Changed text-filter scanning behavior to avoid the results/no-results blinking loop when filtering by Text Detected or No Text Detected.

---

## v1.1.23

### Summary

This release adds manual OCR text extraction, searchable detected text, and a new Scanners settings category, giving you much more control over text-related metadata tasks.

## v1.1.7

### Summary

This release sharpens the Image Comparison workflow so it is easier to judge mismatched files at a glance and review near-duplicates with clearer visual cues. It also refreshes the README to better highlight duplicate and similar-image cleanup.

### Highlights

- Smaller images in the comparison viewer now scale up to match the larger image for more useful side-by-side inspection.
- The comparison panel now shows clearer status messages for upscaled images and aspect-ratio differences.
- Comparison review labels were clarified so Best Overall stays tied to the full similar-image group while the panel can separately identify the best image in the current comparison.

### Added

#### Comparison Guidance

- Added comparison status labels that call out when one side was upscaled to match the other and when the compared images use different aspect ratios

### Changed

#### Comparison Matching

- Updated the center comparison viewer so the smaller image is resized to match the larger image during direct A/B inspection
- Refined aspect-ratio detection so images with effectively matching proportions are not mislabeled because of small resolution differences

#### Comparison Review Controls

- Improved comparison `Keep` and `Best Overall` behavior so comparison selections stay aligned with similar-image review state more consistently
- Updated comparison labels so `Best Overall` remains reserved for the full similar-image group while the panel separately calls out `Best in Comparison`

#### Documentation

- Refreshed README positioning and screenshots to emphasize duplicate finding, similar image review, and the Image Comparison workflow more clearly

## v1.1.6

### Summary

This release introduces Image Comparison, a new workspace for evaluating two images in place without leaving the gallery. It integrates directly with duplicate and similarity review, making it faster to inspect differences, choose the better version, and clean up near-duplicates with confidence.

### Highlights

New Image Comparison panel with left and right image slots plus a central reveal slider for true in-place A/B review

Load images using drag and drop, browse buttons, or gallery context menu actions such as Compare Images and Compare With Left/Right

Synchronized zoom and pan keep both images aligned during close inspection, with hold-to-isolate preview on either side for quick single-image checks

Comparison cards preserve keep/best actions and recalculate smart labels specifically for the current two-image decision instead of reusing broader group context

### Added

#### Image Comparison Mode

- Added a new **Image Comparison** panel beneath the gallery with left and right image slots plus a central overlay viewer
- Added drag-and-drop, browse button, and gallery context menu entry points for loading images into comparison
- Added an in-place reveal slider that shows the left image on one side and the right image on the other for fast visual A/B review
- Added synchronized mouse-wheel zoom with cursor focus and shared pan behavior so both images stay aligned during close inspection
- Added hold-to-isolate preview so either image can be viewed alone temporarily without leaving comparison mode

#### Comparison Workflow Integration

- Added comparison actions that integrate with the existing duplicate and similarity review workflow, including `Keep`, `Mark as Best`, and `Delete`
- Added recalculated labels and best-overall suggestions for the current two-image comparison instead of reusing labels from a larger similarity group
- Added contextual gallery actions for `Compare Images`, `Compare Image`, `Compare With Left`, and `Compare With Right`

### Changed

#### Bottom Panel Usage

- Repurposed the existing bottom panel shell from the AI placeholder into the new **Image Comparison** workspace
- Opening **Settings** now temporarily hides the comparison panel so the settings window can use the full center height before restoring it afterward

#### Comparison Panel Polish

- Refined the comparison card layout so filename and metadata remain inside each image card while labels and actions stay below
- Improved thumbnail resizing to preserve aspect ratio without cropping or stretching while staying responsive as the panel is resized
- Improved slider behavior so it snaps fully to the loaded side when only one image is present, then auto-centers once when a second image is added
- Improved small-window behavior with scrollable comparison side columns, tighter card spacing, better control alignment, and settings-category scrolling
- Improved comparison accent styling so labels, controls, checkboxes, and image cards update correctly with theme accent changes

### Removed

- Removed the unused AI chat placeholder content from the bottom panel in favor of the new **Image Comparison** workspace

---

### Changed

- **Video Preview Reliability** - Rebuilt the preview-above-details video pipeline to restore metadata, static posters, explicit in-place playback, lightbox double-click, and stable delete behavior without the earlier crashes.
- **Accent Contrast** - Improved accent-color readability in lower-contrast situations by dynamically increasing contrast where needed.
- **File Tree Visual Polish** - Refined tree and pinned-folder styling so selected folders use bold accent text without tinting icons, and chevrons only render when folders actually have children.
- **Header Branding** - Replaced the header logo.

---

## v1.1.3

### Added

- **Sidebar Video Player** - In-place video playback directly above the metadata panel.
- **Text Detection Filter** - 3-stage text detection system (Likely, More Likely, Verified) powered by OpenCV and OCR.

---

## v1.0.22

### Added

- **Bottom AI Panel Shell**: Added a new hideable and resizable bottom panel with persisted visibility and size so the upcoming AI chat area has a dedicated place in the layout.
- **Explorer-Style Address Bar**: Replaced the simple selected-folder label with a full Windows Explorer-style address bar that shows the full path as clickable breadcrumbs.
- **Breadcrumb Folder Menus**: Added dropdown chevrons between breadcrumb segments and at the end of the current path so nearby folders can be opened directly from the address bar.

### Changed

- **Navigation Responsiveness**: Moved breadcrumb folder enumeration, gallery counts, and gallery listing requests off the UI thread so folder navigation is less likely to freeze the app.
- **Tree Sync Scheduling**: Changed native tree synchronization so folder navigation updates the selected folder first and coalesces heavier tree sync work behind a deferred timer instead of doing it immediately on every navigation.
- **Address Bar Interaction**: Added editable-path mode plus keyboard navigation and lazy-expanding flyout menus so the address bar behaves much closer to Windows Explorer.
- **Header Wrapping**: Updated the header layout so pagination drops below the address bar on narrower widths instead of overlapping it.
- **Release Build Safety**: Hardened the release build flow to catch stale packaged artifacts before producing an installer and kept `setup.cfg` versioning in sync during version bumps.

---

## v1.0.21

### Added

- **Explorer-Style Folder Navigation**: Added `Back`, `Up`, `Forward`, and `Refresh` controls beside the selected-folder readout for faster folder browsing.

### Changed

- **Context Menu Placement**: Refined right-click menu positioning so menus stay fully visible on screen instead of getting clipped near the bottom or edges.
- **Native Drag Preview Overhaul**: Replaced the Windows shell drag preview with a native in-app drag stack that keeps original aspect ratios, supports larger previews, and positions the preview/tooltip stack cleanly beside the cursor.
- **Multi-Item Drag Stacks**: Multi-select drags now show overlapping preview thumbnails so stacked drags communicate that multiple files are moving or copying.
- **Left Tree Navigation Behavior**: Restored the file tree so normal folder navigation highlights subfolders without re-rooting the tree unexpectedly.

---

## v1.0.20

### Added

- **Metadata Detail Group Headings**: Added `General`, `Camera`, and `AI` section headings to the single-item metadata details panel so dense metadata is easier to scan.

### Changed

- **Gallery Folder Drag and Drop**: Fixed dragging files from the gallery into folder cards shown inside the gallery, while preserving cancel behavior when dropping back on the same item or gallery background.
- **Timeline Polish Pass**: Added active/visible/dim anchor emphasis, corrected the bottom-of-gallery anchor edge case, made the timeline resize against the visible gallery viewport, improved its final positioning, and cleaned up the rounded shell rendering.
- **Metadata Panel Cleanup**: Removed unwanted Qt label indentation/left rules from metadata labels and headings, kept detail-only group headers out of bulk/empty states, and restyled `Clear Tags From DB` to match the other bulk tag editor actions.
- **Glassmorphism Removal**: Removed the appearance toggle and remaining blur/translucency paths so the header, lightbox, and other surfaces render fully opaque without flicker around animated GIFs and videos.
- **Sidebar Divider Stability**: Refined the native sidebar splitter/divider rendering so borders and resize hover states render crisply instead of appearing too thin or flickering.

### Removed

- **Glassmorphism Setting**: Removed the `Enable glassmorphism` appearance option and its remaining runtime wiring.

---

## v1.0.19

### Added

- **What's New Release Notes**: The `What's New` dialog now shows the polished `ReleaseNotes.md` summary first, followed by the full bundled changelog for users who want the detailed breakdown.
- **Timeline Navigation Arrows**: Added dedicated up/down controls to the timeline rail so dense timelines more clearly communicate that extra dates are available above or below the current viewport.

### Changed

- **Timeline Navigation Overhaul**: Rebuilt the grouped-date timeline to use one anchor per real date header, unified tooltip behavior, smoother drag and wheel scrubbing, a hybrid viewported anchor rail for dense timelines, and granularity-specific sizing for day, month, and year modes.
- **Infinite Scroll Policy**: Switched grouped-date non-masonry views plus `List`, `Details`, `Content`, `Small Grid`, and `Medium Grid` to infinite scroll so timeline navigation and long-form browsing are no longer broken up by pagination.
- **Header Responsiveness**: Moved the panel toggle and settings buttons beside Search and reworked the header layout so the controls wrap more cleanly on narrower widths instead of clipping off the right edge.
- **Bundled Help Content**: Packaged `SEARCH_SYNTAX.md` and `ReleaseNotes.md` with installed builds so help/release dialogs work outside the raw development environment.
- **Startup Folder Settings**: Corrected startup-folder settings state so the Browse button and related controls stay enabled/disabled based on the real `restore_last` setting.

---

## v1.0.18

### Changed

- **Details Header Layout**: Refined regular and grouped Details header spacing, sticky positioning, separator styling, and scroll-state behavior so both modes align cleanly without visible jumps or header gaps.
- **Grouped Details Columns**: Fixed grouped-by-date Details mode so the shared resizable header stays aligned with filenames, folders, sizes, and other row data below it while resizing.
- **Sidebar Width Persistence**: Corrected sidebar state persistence so reopening panels restores their previous usable widths instead of saving and restoring zero-width sidebars.
- **WebEngine Startup Stability**: Deferred the initial WebEngine background-color setup until after the event loop starts, avoiding native startup aborts seen on some installed Windows machines.

---

## v1.0.17

### Added

- **Crash Diagnostics**: Added local crash-report generation, `faulthandler` logging, and Help menu actions to create a diagnostic report or open the crash-report folder for troubleshooting installed builds on other machines.

### Changed

- **Packaged Runtime Stability**: Hardened packaged startup/runtime behavior by normalizing AI metadata values before JSON persistence, preventing scan-time failures from non-serializable EXIF values like Pillow `IFDRational`.
- **Details Panel States**: Updated the right sidebar so it shows a true empty-state prompt when nothing is selected and switches to a dedicated bulk tag editor when multiple files are selected.
- **Bulk Tag Editing**: Refined bulk tag save/embed behavior so entered tags append to existing DB and embedded file tags instead of replacing them.

---

## v1.0.16

### Changed

- **Grouped Details View**: Fixed grouped Details mode so only one sticky column header appears at the top, date groups collapse correctly, sticky date headers sit beneath the Details header, and the header seam no longer exposes scrolling content behind it.
- **List Context Menu**: Refined list-view context menu layering so the custom right-click menu reliably appears above gallery rows instead of being visually overlapped by list items.
- **Fresh Install Bootstrap**: Updated the packaged database initialization flow to bundle and load the SQL schema correctly in installed builds, preventing first-run launch failures caused by missing `app\\mediamanager\\db` resources.

---

## v1.0.15

### Added

- **Date Grouping**: Added `Group By Date` across gallery views with date headers, collapsible sections, and a right-side jump/scrub timeline.
- **Date Metadata Fields**: Added `Date Taken`, `Date Acquired`, `Date Created`, and `Date Modified` to metadata settings and the Details sidebar for images, GIFs, and videos.

### Changed

- **Timeline UI**: Refined the timeline scrubber layout, spacing, padding, coloring, and docked sizing so it no longer overlaps the gallery and behaves predictably while resizing.
- **Metadata Dates**: Updated scanning, import, save, and embed flows to extract and persist filesystem dates plus EXIF/XMP-style taken/acquired dates, and made `Date Taken` and `Date Acquired` editable in the sidebar.
- **Date Labels**: Renamed date labels throughout the app for consistency with Windows Properties and the Details/settings panels.

---

## v1.0.14

### Changed

- **Installer Build**: Updated the packaged Windows app so background media scanning and related `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` work no longer opens console windows while scanning folders.

---
